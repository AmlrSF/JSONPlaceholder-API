# To-Do List Application with JSONPlaceholder API

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

This is a simple **To-Do List Application** built using **ReactJS** and **TypeScript**. The app fetches data from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos) to display to-do items. Users can add new tasks locally, mark items as completed, delete them, and filter the displayed items.
